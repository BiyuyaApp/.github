## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** using the branch naming convention (see below).
4. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear and descriptive messages.
5. **Push your changes** to your fork.
6. **Create a pull request** to the main repository.

## Branch Naming Convention

To maintain a consistent branch naming strategy, we follow this pattern:

```regex
^(feat|ci|build|fix|hotfix|chore)\([a-zA-Z0-9-]+\): .+$
